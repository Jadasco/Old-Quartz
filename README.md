This is a small resource pack that replaces the newer quartz block texture in minecraft with an older texture lacking the border on part of the side faces. 
This means it can seamlessly connect to smooth quartz blocks on the left side, and makes a nice repeating 2x1 pattern that looks like a large brick. 

It only changes the texture of one side of one block, and should be compatible most other packs. the 16x16 png used belongs to mojang
